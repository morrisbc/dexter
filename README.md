# Dexter
A tool designed to help trainers know type matchups between their 
pokemon and their opponent's so they may use them to their advantage during
battles.

# Motivation
How many times have you been in a Pok&eacute;mon battle and asked yourself, "What 
type are they again?" or "What type are they weak against?" If you're like me, 
a lot. This tool was created for this reason. It's something you can use to quickly 
lookup your (or your opponent's) Pok&eacute;mon and get valuable information
on what type they are, and what types they take the most damage from.
